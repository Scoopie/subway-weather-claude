# Feature Specification: Temperature Route Visualizer

**Feature Branch**: `001-i-want-to`  
**Created**: 2025-09-13  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "I want to build a web app that shows the temperatures along the route. The user can specify the start and end addresses. The temperatures will be visualised in a subway style map, listing the locations that are along the route to the destination. The start and end destinations are on a separate screen to the route map. The user can navigate straight to the route map after the initial route selection. The route persists across sessions. There is a thick line along the route path. The colour of the line varies along the route, based on the nearest temperature report. locations along the route are represented by circles on the line, like a subway map"

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input 
   ’ If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description 
   ’ Identified: web app, temperature data, routing, subway-style visualization
3. For each unclear aspect: 
   ’ Temperature data source, route calculation method, session storage marked
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section 
   ’ Clear user flow from route selection to visualization
5. Generate Functional Requirements 
   ’ Each requirement tested for clarity and measurability
6. Identify Key Entities 
   ’ Route, Location, Temperature data identified
7. Run Review Checklist 
   ’ Warnings noted for clarifications needed
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ¡ Quick Guidelines
-  Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- L Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- =e Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies  
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
A commuter wants to see temperature variations along their travel route to make informed decisions about clothing and travel timing. They enter their start and end addresses, view the route with temperature-coded visualization, and can return to this information in future sessions without re-entering their route.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** user is on the route selection screen, **When** they enter valid start and end addresses and submit, **Then** the system calculates the route and navigates to the temperature visualization map
2. **Given** user has previously set up a route, **When** they return to the application, **Then** they can navigate directly to their saved route visualization
3. **Given** user is viewing the temperature map, **When** temperature data is available along the route, **Then** the route line displays color variations corresponding to temperature differences
4. **Given** user is viewing the route, **When** they look at location markers, **Then** they see circular indicators positioned along the route line showing specific temperature readings

### Edge Cases
- What happens when one or both addresses cannot be found or mapped?
- How does the system handle routes with no available temperature data?
- What occurs when temperature data is stale or unavailable for some route segments?
- How does the system behave when the route calculation fails?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST allow users to input start and end addresses on a dedicated route selection screen
- **FR-002**: System MUST calculate a route between the specified start and end addresses
- **FR-003**: System MUST display the route as a thick line on a subway-style map visualization
- **FR-004**: System MUST obtain temperature data for locations along the calculated route
- **FR-005**: System MUST color-code the route line based on temperature variations along the path
- **FR-006**: System MUST display location markers as circles positioned on the route line
- **FR-007**: System MUST show temperature values at each location marker
- **FR-008**: System MUST persist the user's route selection across browser sessions
- **FR-009**: System MUST provide navigation from route selection screen directly to the temperature map
- **FR-010**: System MUST allow users to return to the temperature map without re-entering route details
- **FR-011**: System MUST handle [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: How should system respond when route calculation fails?]
- **FR-012**: System MUST obtain temperature data from [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: What is the source for temperature data - weather API, sensors, historical data?]
- **FR-013**: System MUST update temperature data [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: How frequently should temperature data refresh?]

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **Route**: Represents the path between start and end addresses, contains geographic coordinates and waypoints
- **Location**: Specific points along the route where temperature is measured, includes coordinates and address information
- **Temperature Reading**: Current temperature value associated with a specific location and timestamp
- **User Session**: Stores the user's selected route information for persistence across visits
