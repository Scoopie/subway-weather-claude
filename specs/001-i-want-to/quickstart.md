# Quickstart Guide: Temperature Route Visualizer

**Feature**: Temperature Route Visualizer  
**Branch**: 001-i-want-to  
**Date**: 2025-09-13

## Test Scenarios for Validation

### Primary User Journey Test
**Scenario**: First-time user creates and views a temperature route

**Steps:**
1. Open the application in browser
2. Verify route selection screen displays with two address input fields
3. Type "New York, NY" in start address field
4. Verify address autocomplete suggestions appear
5. Select "New York, NY, USA" from suggestions
6. Type "Boston, MA" in end address field
7. Select "Boston, MA, USA" from suggestions
8. Click "Generate Route" button
9. Verify navigation to temperature visualization screen
10. Verify route line displays between the two cities
11. Verify route line has color variations (temperature gradient)
12. Verify circular markers appear at intervals along the route
13. Click on a route marker
14. Verify temperature popup displays with actual temperature value
15. Close browser and reopen application
16. Verify can navigate directly to saved route without re-entering addresses

**Expected Results:**
- Route creation completes in <3 seconds
- Temperature data loads for at least 80% of route points
- Route line shows smooth color transitions
- All interactive elements respond within 500ms
- Route persists across browser sessions

### Edge Case Tests

#### Test 1: Invalid Address Handling
**Steps:**
1. Enter "Invalid Address 12345xyz" in start field
2. Attempt to proceed
3. **Expected**: Error message displayed, cannot proceed until valid address entered

#### Test 2: No Route Available
**Steps:**
1. Enter address in Hawaii for start
2. Enter address in mainland US for end
3. Attempt route generation
4. **Expected**: Graceful error handling with alternative suggestions or error message

#### Test 3: Temperature Data Unavailable
**Steps:**
1. Create route in remote location (e.g., Antarctica coordinates)
2. **Expected**: Route displays without temperature coloring, shows message about unavailable data

### Performance Validation

#### Load Time Test
- **Target**: Application loads in <2 seconds on 3G connection
- **Acceptance**: Time to interactive <2s

#### Route Calculation Test
- **Target**: Route with temperature data ready in <5 seconds
- **Acceptance**: 95% of routes complete within target

### API Integration Tests

#### Weather Underground API
Expected: Returns temperature data in expected format

#### Google Places API
Expected: Returns formatted address suggestions

#### OpenRouteService API  
Expected: Returns route waypoints

### Data Validation Tests

#### Route Storage Test
1. Create route with 20+ waypoints
2. Close browser
3. Reopen and verify all route data intact
4. **Expected**: All waypoints and temperature data preserved

#### Temperature Refresh Test
1. View route with fresh temperature data
2. Wait 11 minutes (past 10-minute expiration)
3. Refresh or revisit route
4. **Expected**: Temperature data automatically refreshes
